Jenifer: I think the government need to increase funding for top universities. Because most of the country's top human resources are from these schools, and increasing funding will allow universities to have better resources for future talent in those countries.
Alan: I don't agree with you. This behavior is unfair to other normal universities.
Jennifer:No,The top school students have enter a better platform by fair competition, and deserve better treatment. So I think it should be better to invest more money in top universities.
Alan: But the alumni of these good schools have already donated a lot of money to their schools each year, but the average university alumni donate relatively less, so this policy is not reasonable.
